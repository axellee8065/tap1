Sure! Here is a simple text representation of the game flow for an HTML5 game using Phaser.js:

1. Main Menu:
   - Display main menu screen with options to start the game or view instructions.
   - Player can click on "Start Game" to proceed to the game play or click on "Instructions" to view game instructions.
   
2. Game Play:
   - Initialize game environment and player character.
   - Player can control the character to navigate through obstacles and enemies.
   - Player earns points for collecting items or completing tasks.
   - Display player's score and remaining lives during the game.
   - If player loses all lives, proceed to Game Over state.

3. Game Over:
   - Display game over screen with final score and options to restart the game or return to main menu.
   - Player can click on "Restart" to start a new game or click on "Main Menu" to return to the main menu.
   
This is a basic outline of the game flow in an HTML5 game using Phaser.js, where the player progresses from the main menu to the game play, and eventually reaches the game over state either by losing all lives or completing the game. More complexity and details can be added depending on the specific game mechanics and features.
